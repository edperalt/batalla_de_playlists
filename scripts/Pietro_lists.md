## The Players!!
 ![](Pi_dad.jpeg)
<br>
<br>

## Two *Spotify* playlists

- Dad`s Beats
- Pietros Playlist 2.0

<br>
<br>


## We want to answer a few questions

<br>
Spotify presents in its API several measures associated to each track, we are basing our challenge in the comparison of this values.
<br>

- Who췂s the retro lover here??
- Anyone for acoustic??
- Dance floor time
- are they happy songs?
- anyone annoying the neighbors??

<br>
<br>

## the True **YOUNG SPIRIT AWARD** goes to...

<br>

## We want to review who is more inclined towards acoustic music

## Loudness is a classic, a loud track.. only makes sense with one volume!!!



```r
  # mutate(terms = reorder_within(terms, abs(value), component)) %>%


battle_df %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, factor) %>%

  top_n(10, loudness ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # head(20) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_segment(aes(x=track.name, xend=track.name, y=-5.5, yend= loudness ) ) +
   geom_point(aes(track.name, y= loudness,  color = playlist), alpha = 1, size = 4)+
 
  scale_colour_manual(values = the_colors,
                      aesthetics = "color") +
  # geom_boxplot(aes(playlist, acousticness ), color="red", width = 0.05) +
  theme_minimal()+
   theme( text = element_text(size=10),legend.position = "bottom") +
